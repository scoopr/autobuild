  autobuild  -  dead simple automation

  Triggers arbitary shell commands on filesystem events.
  By default monitors current working directory, which can be changed with -d
  flag. 

  It ignores events that are notified after the command is run, for avoiding endless loops.
  This ignore duration in seconds can be changed with -i flag.

  On Mac OS X, there is additional value 'latency', which can be changed with -l flag

  For example, automatically run test-suite
  $ autobuild make check

  Or build a website 
  $ autobuild 'cat header.html content.html footer.html > index.html'
